# Stronger Baselines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Language Models (2025)

This repository serves as the **overview and entry point** for the code and experiments presented in our paper:

Alex Laitenberger, Christopher D. Manning and Nelson F. Liu. 2025. **Stronger Baselines for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Long-Context Language Models**

Our goal is to provide **full reproducibility** of all experiments in the paper. Below, you will find links to the individual repositories for each method, along with instructions on how to set up the experiment framework.

## 📌 Repo-Overview

### Analyzed Methods
